	<h4>Layout</h4>
	<p>I started to prefer a view with one game per line, while simplifying the information displayed.  <em>For instance, 
		no location info, no team records info.</em>
	</p>
	<p>I think I can include the game date, as it'll be needed to make 
		players aware of deadlines.
	</p>
	<h4>Workflow for Making Picks</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Clicking a button (e.g. "Pick Duke") will <strong><em>temporarily</em></strong> save the pick.</li>
		<li>Picks aren't finalized until the <strong><em>Finalize Picks</em></strong> is clicked.
	</ul>
	<p>Is that easier than last season's design?</p>
